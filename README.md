A Dataset to train a model to classify between a painting and a photograph.



## Context
The task of classifying a painting from a photograph might actually sound pretty simple, but when given a thought about the task it makes us realize that there are a lot of corner cases for a classifier. I hope this dataset provides a basis to understand the task of classification in-depth.

## Content
The dataset contains three folders: Training, Validation, and Testing with 2 folders representing each class in each folder. The data in the dataset is scraped from the web and copied to different folders making it easy to load the data into notebooks. The task is to achieve the highest possible accuracy and prevent overfitting the data at the same time. Hope this problem is fun to work on!

## Inspiration
When looking for a dataset for this specific classification task (Paintings/Photograph), there was no proper dataset available for such an interesting problem. The main question which excited me to create this dataset is the question of how to classify a photograph of painting under the class-Photograph instead of class-Painting.
